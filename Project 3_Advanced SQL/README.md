This project centers on the SQL Murder Mystery Lab, an interactive investigation designed to build proficiency in SQL by applying real querying techniques to solve a fictional crime. Working within a structured lab environment, the project involved exploring a database using SQL commands to retrieve, filter, sort, and analyze data across multiple tables. Students began by examining the schema and ERD to understand table relationships, data types, and the volume of records before progressively using more advanced SQL syntax, including complex WHERE clauses, GROUP BY aggregations, aliases, and multi-table JOINs.

Using these skills, the investigation simulated a real-world analytics scenario: uncovering clues, identifying witnesses, reviewing crime scene details, and piecing together information scattered across the database. By iteratively querying the police department’s dataset, filtering potential suspects, and validating findings with supporting records, the project reinforced core concepts in data exploration, relational thinking, and step-by-step problem solving. The final outcome demonstrates the practical use of SQL as a tool for investigation, data validation, and insight generation—key competencies for database management and analytics roles.
