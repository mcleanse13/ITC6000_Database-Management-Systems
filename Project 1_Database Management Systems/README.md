Module Overview

This module introduces the fundamentals of Database Management Systems, focusing on modern database use-cases, high-level architecture, and core design principles. Students will learn the basics of data modeling and gain hands-on experience creating Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) using Draw.IO, an industry-standard visual modeling tool used for diagramming and solution design across Informatics and Analytics roles.

Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Describe common database use-cases and high-level system architecture

Practice Entity Relationship Modeling (ERM) concepts

Create Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to represent data structures

Module Activities

You will watch introductory videos on Draw.IO to understand its interface and capabilities, then follow a guided exercise to build an ERD step-by-step. After reviewing the provided movie spreadsheet and identifying candidate keys, you will design your own ER diagram in Draw.IO and submit it as your final deliverable for the module.
