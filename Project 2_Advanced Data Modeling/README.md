This project explores advanced data modeling concepts with a strong focus on designing clean, reliable, and efficient database structures. Through lessons on referential integrity, normalization, naming conventions, data types, and data storage principles, the module emphasizes why proper database design is essential for performance, accuracy, and long-term maintainability. Students work hands-on with the NEU student database and DB Browser for SQLite, practicing SQL syntax, creating data structures, cleansing external datasets, and understanding how anomalies and poor design choices affect real-world systems. The curriculum highlights both theory and process, teaching how to move from conceptual modeling to high-quality relational structures that stakeholders and downstream users can trust.

Building on these foundations, the project guides students through importing, cleaning, and validating data, identifying issues such as type mismatches and inconsistent formatting that commonly arise in analytics and informatics workflows. By the end, students gain practical skills applicable to enterprise databases: interpreting complex ERDs, designing normalized schemas, performing successful data migrations, and creating small proof-of-concept databases to support business decision-making. The final deliverable involves populating tables from a structured movies dataset using SQLite, demonstrating the student's ability to apply database theory to a functional, real-world solution.
