Case Study: Predictive Modeling for Alumni Donations

This project demonstrates how predictive data modeling can enhance a university’s alumni donation campaign by identifying which alumni are most likely to contribute, estimating donation amounts, and accounting for spontaneous gifts. Using historical donation records, demographic information, and behavioral patterns, the models allow the university to efficiently allocate the $15-per-alum targeting budget, improve segmentation, and maximize return on investment. The iterative nature of predictive modeling ensures strategies can be refined over time as alumni behavior and external factors change.

Assignment – CASE Tools for Database Design

This project evaluates three CASE tools—central repositories, Lucidchart, and erwin Data Modeler—for their roles in database design and software development. Each tool supports collaboration and integration but serves different purposes: repositories centralize data storage, Lucidchart facilitates visual diagramming, and erwin enables database schema modeling. The analysis highlights benefits like improved efficiency, teamwork, and workflow consistency, while also noting potential drawbacks such as training requirements and implementation costs. CASE tools are most effective when carefully aligned with project goals and organizational needs.
