This project focuses on the importance of database security and the responsibility data professionals carry when safeguarding sensitive information such as PII, PHI, PCI, and other high-risk data stored across modern systems. As part of understanding the real-world consequences of database breaches, this module required researching a major security incident from the past five years in which a database, cloud repository, or similar storage system was compromised and caused significant business or financial harm. The goal was to analyze what happened, identify the data involved, and reflect on the broader implications for security, system design, and professional accountability in roles that manage sensitive data.

For this assignment, I examined the 23andMe data breach and resulting lawsuit, in which attackers gained access to user profiles, images, and highly sensitive genetic information by exploiting recycled login credentials. The breach disproportionately targeted users of Chinese and Ashkenazi Jewish descent, raising racial, social, and political concerns and highlighting the risks of storing large volumes of sensitive data without sufficient controls. My analysis covered the impacts on customers, the company’s delayed breach notification, and the legal and ethical issues surrounding the incident. I also reflected on lessons learned from my own experience working in healthcare, where strict HIPAA compliance and collaboration with legal teams were essential during prior data breaches. This project emphasizes the critical need for strong security practices, transparent procedures, and responsible data stewardship in any analytics or informatics role.
