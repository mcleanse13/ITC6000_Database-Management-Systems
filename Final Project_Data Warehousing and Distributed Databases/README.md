Final Project - BandsInTown Database Project

This final project explores how data is transformed into information, knowledge, and ultimately actionable insights through the design and implementation of a database-driven application. Using the live-music discovery app BandsInTown as the project focus, the work models how a real-world service collects, stores, and leverages user, artist, event, and recommendation data to personalize the concert-discovery experience. Throughout the project, key database concepts—including functional requirements, ER modeling, NoSQL considerations, SQL-based data retrieval, and system architecture—are applied to simulate how BandsInTown supports millions of users with features such as artist following, music recommendations, upcoming tour alerts, and ticket-purchase integration. The project emphasizes how thoughtful data modeling and business rules directly influence user experience, platform functionality, and the ability to support analytics over large and evolving datasets.

Building on module-by-module development, this project includes defined user personas, a detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), multi-table SQL queries reflecting real platform interactions, analytics use cases, security and privacy considerations, and a recommended architecture using scalable cloud services. The resulting design demonstrates how an n-tier structure, supported by platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, can meet the performance needs of a high-traffic, data-intensive application. Additionally, the project highlights the importance of communication in technical work—showing not only how the database is built, but why each design choice supports the broader business challenge of connecting users with live music. Overall, this project strengthened skills in data modeling, SQL, system analysis, and technical communication while illustrating how well-designed databases enable modern applications to evolve alongside user behavior and industry trends.
